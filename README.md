# Sudocode

Sudocode, as the name suggests, is the supreme coding tool for everyone. Using sudocode, one actually need not learn how to code in C or C++.<br>
This particular tool helps you with converting your pseudocode to code.<br>
All you need to do is follow some rules laid here and you'll be good to go. For now, this particular thing only converts pseudocode to C code. But I'll soon be expanding this to convert pseudocode to python and C++ code too.<br>

It's a fairly simple project and does not involve any Machine Learning, but yes, implementing this using ML is definitely on the cards.<br>
But for now, it's going to be just some code written with some common sense to help achieve this.<br>

The rules to be followed while writing pseudocode will be made available soon! <br>
